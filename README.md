# Stegbar Legacy CMS to Shopify Migration 

## Project Overview
Stegbar is an international brand with a large-scale website containing both ecommerce and non-ecommerce content.  
The original platform was built on a legacy CMS (Optimizely / Episerver) with a highly complex backend and performance limitations.

Due to frequent server slowdowns and maintenance challenges, the client decided to migrate the entire platform to Shopify while preserving the existing design and user experience.
